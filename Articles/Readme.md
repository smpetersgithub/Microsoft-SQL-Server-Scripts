## Overview
Welcome to this GitHub repository.  Here, I've saved some documentation I created on SQL Server; which is mostly copied from the SQL Server documentation.

## How to Use
Feel free to rummage around.  I'm constantly adding and reorganizing this site, so if you cannot find anything, let me know, and I would be happy to help.

## Notes
:keyboard:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All SQL is written in Microsoft SQL Server T-SQL, unless otherwise noted.

:question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions, please feel free to create a GitHub discussion. I am always happy to help out and explain different solutions.

:mailbox:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any inaccuracies, misspellings, bugs, dead links, etc., please report an issue! No detail is too small, and I appreciate all the help.

:smile:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy coding!

I hope you find this repository useful and informative, and I welcome any new puzzles or tips and tricks you may have. I also have a WordPress site where you can find my data analytics projects, Python puzzles, and blog.
