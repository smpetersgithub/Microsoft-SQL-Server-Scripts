# Microsoft SQL Server Scripts

This repository contains a collection of my SQL scripts saved in one convenient place.  Feel free to rummage around.  

In the **Tools** folder, you'll find an assortment of useful scripts, including those for generating a well-structured calendar table, conducting data profiling, and offering quick fixes for common data issues I face on a routine basis.  These scripts are a little more involved and I include instructions on their usage. 

The **Scripts** folder serves as a repository for all the scripts I employ to query system tables or provide some quick solutions to common problems.  These scripts are pretty straight forward, just follow the code comments at the top of each script.

:question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions, please feel free to create a GitHub discussion. I am always happy to help out and explain different solutions.

:mailbox:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any inaccuracies, misspellings, bugs, dead links, etc., please report an issue! No detail is too small, and I appreciate all the help.

:smile:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy coding!

I hope you find this repository useful and informative, and I welcome any new puzzles or tips and tricks you may have. I also have a WordPress site where you can find my data analytics projects, Python puzzles, and blog.
