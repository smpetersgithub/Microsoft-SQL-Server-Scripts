## Overview
Welcome to the SQL Server Toolbox.  In this directory, I have my sql scripts (i.e. my "tools") that I use for data profiling, auditing, transformation, and much more.

Feel free to rummage around.

## How to Use
Each folder in this repository is self-contained and includes a readme explaining its purpose, usage, and any prerequisites.

## Notes
:keyboard:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All SQL is written in Microsoft SQL Server T-SQL, unless otherwise noted.

:question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any questions, please feel free to create a GitHub discussion. I am always happy to help out and explain different solutions.

:mailbox:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any inaccuracies, misspellings, bugs, dead links, etc., please report an issue! No detail is too small, and I appreciate all the help.

:smile:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy coding!

I hope you find this repository useful and informative, and I welcome any new puzzles or tips and tricks you may have. I also have a WordPress site where you can find my data analytics projects, Python puzzles, and blog.
